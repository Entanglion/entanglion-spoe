# Entanglion: Space Pirates
Mastered Entanglion and looking for more of a challenge? You've come to the right place!

Entanglion: Space Pirates introduces a number of new game elements to make Entanglion more challenging and more rewarding.

> ⚠️ Entanglion: Space Pirates is a work in progress and we are looking for feedback on mechanics, game length, balance, and anything else that could make this expansion more enjoyable. Please open an [issue](../../issues) and leave us your feedback!

## Overview
You are the captain of an intergalactic mining business, but you have always dreamed of what life would be like as a space pirate, wandering the universe in search of the best loot. The good news is that the Space Pirates of Entanglion (SPOE) are seeking a new captain to join their ranks! The bad news is that membership into this elite pirate group requires achieving a certain level of technological sophistication -- one might say, _quantum_ sophistication -- and they're going to take the first qualified applicant.

Do you have what it takes to outsmart, outmaneuver, and outwit your competition in order to become the biggest, baddest, most quantumly-ruthless Space Pirate of Entanglion?

> 🤔 Want to buy a boxed copy? We will publish a copy of Entanglion: Space Pirates at [The Game Crafter](http://thegamecrafter.com), once we are satisfied that the rules are balanced. It will require a copy of the base [Entanglion](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/entanglion1) game.

### Game board
The new Entanglion: Space Pirates gameboard builds on top of the existing Entanglion game board, but adds a few new features:

- New ships! The Yearling and the Grenada are competitors to the Rubicon and Mercurial. The game board adds a new engine control section for this new fleet.
- Competition! Two players compete against each other for quantum supremacy 
- Pirates! Pirates can help you on your journey, for a price.
- New instructions on turn order and actions
- New Quantum Depot structure for forging quantum components
- Updated Quantum events

### Spaceship boards (2)
The spaceship boards are used to manage your fleet of ships: Rubicon/Mercurial and Yearling/Grenada. They contain slots for cargo and quantum components, and a quantum power tracking meter. These boards are used in place of the stock spaceship boards from Entanglion.

### Planet tokens (8)
Planets in Entanglion may have resource mines, pirate outposts, or nothing at all! There are three kinds of resources that can be mined -- Copper, Helium-3 (He3), and Niodium (Nb) -- and are they used to purchase quantum components.

### Quantum Depot token
The Quantum Depot is where quantum components are created from raw materials. It is located in the Superious galaxy.

### Quantum components (8)
Quantum components are re-used from the base Entanglion game. They increase the Quantum Power (QP) of your fleet.

| Component | Quantum Power | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Qubits | +1 QP | 2 Copper |
| Qubit Interconnect | +1 QP | 2 He3 |
| Dilution Refrigerator | +3 QP | 2 Copper + 2 He3 |
| Magnetic Shielding | +3 QP | 3 He3 + 1 Niudium |
| Control Infrastructure | +3 QP | 2 Copper + 2 Niodium |
| Quantum Gates | +4 QP | 2 Copper + 1 He3 + 2 Niodium |
| Quantum Programming | +4 QP | 2 Copper + 2 He3 + 1 Niodium |
| Quantum Error Correction | +5 QP | 1 Copper + 1 He3 + 4 Niodium |

### Pirate cards (12)
Pirates are obtained from pirate outposts and provide effects during the course of play. Pirates cost any 3 resources to hire.

| Pirate | Effect |

| Harry the Haggler | At the Quantum Depot, you may trade any 2 resources for 1 resource of your choice When you lose an encounter, you choose the resource to give your opponent |


### Quantum event cards (39)
Quantum event cards are drawn when a quantum event is triggered by playing 6 engine cards in engine control. Entanglion: Space Pirates introduces a new set of quantum events. These cards are held in your hand and played at any point during the game, unless otherwise specified. Players may hold a maximum of 3 quantum event cards in their hand.

Quantum events in the base Entanglion game are not used in the Space Pirate expansion unless they are listed in the table above.

> 🏠 House rule: for a more lively game, quantum event cards may also be drawn when exiting Entanglion, as in the base rule set.

### First player token (1)
This token is used to determine which player takes the first action during each round. Players alternate taking the first action after each round.

### PROBE cards (2)
Two additional PROBE cards are used in Entanglion: Space Pirates, one for each fleet. These cards enable players to take an action in the middle of their turn.

## Game Setup
Preparation of Entanglion: Space Pirates is as follows.

1. **Spaceship cards**. Each player receives one spaceship card for their fleet. Rubicon/Mercurial form one fleet and Yearling/Grenada form the other.
2. **Planet tokens**. Shuffle the planet tokens and place one face down on each planet in the Entanglion system.
3. **Quantum Depot**. Roll the Centarious die and place the Quantum Depot on the indicated planet in Superious (0 -> Minus, 1 -> Plus).
4. **Engine cards**. Distribute the colored PROBE cards to each player and place the remaining (black) PROBE card with the rest of the engine cards. Shuffle and place the engine cards face down on the engine card stack. Deal three engine cards to each player.
5. **Pirate cards**. Shuffle the pirate cards and place them face down in the two pirate outposts.
6. **Quantum event cards**. Shuffle the quantum event cards and place them face down on the quantum event stack.
7. **Determine first player**. Determine the first player by rolling the Entanglion die. The player with the highest roll goes first and takes possession of the first player token. Re-roll in case of a tie 
8. **Spaceship placement**. The first player may choose which planet their fleet begins on in Centarious. The other player's fleet begins on the other planet in Centarious. Both spaceships in a fleet begin on the same planet.
9. **Draw initial Quantum Event**. Each player draws a Quantum Event.

## Round Overview
A round consists of four phases: navigate, resolve, action, and cleanup.

### Navigate phase
Beginning with the first player, players alternate taking turns placing engine cards in their own engine control section on the board. Each turn, a player may play a card face down or pass their turn. Players can place up to six engine cards. Players immediately draw a replacement card after placing a card. Once an engine card is placed facedown, players cannot look at the facedown engine card until it is flipped face up in the Resolve phase. Once a player passes their turn, they may not place any additional engine cards during this round.

> 🚀 To simplify navigation, the orientation of the engine cards does not matter; engine cards are not played on a specific ship in your fleet. Your ships may traverse any valid path for a given engine card, independent of whether it is colored red or blue.

> 🔀 Remember to shuffle the engine card discard pile when the engine card stack is empty!

If a player places six engine cards in their engine control, they have triggered a quantum event. Draw a quantum event card and keep it in your hand immediately after placing the sixth engine card.

> 🃏 Your fleet's PROBE card must always be played face up.

### Resolve phase
After both players have passed during the navigate phase, players begin resolving their navigation actions. Beginning with the first player, players alternatively reveal the next hidden engine card and perform the appropriate navigation action with their spaceships.

If a player's navigation action cannot be legally resolved, that player's ship does not move. That player must discard their remaining engine cards in their navigation control. That player's turn ends.

During the resolve phase, one or both of a player's spaceships may occupy the same planet as the spaceships of their opponent. This event is called a spaceship encounter. Resolve the spaceship encounter as described in the next section.

If a player reveals a PROBE card, they may immediately make an action as described below.

### Action phase
Immediately after a player resolves their last navigation action, they proceed to the action phrase. Players may perform any of the following actions, depending on the planet(s) at which their fleet is located:

- **Discover planet**. Undiscovered planets in the Entanglion system are those with their planet tokens face down. Flip the planet token to discover what lies on the planet.
    - ☠️ Pirate outpost: Flip all pirates at the designated outpost face up. Recruit one pirate of your choice from the outpost into your fleet.
    - ⛏️ Mine: Receive two of the discovered resource.
- **Mine**. At a planet with resources, mine those resources by moving some or all of any resource tokens present on the planet to the cargo holds of your fleet. 
- **Hire pirate**. At a pirate outpost, hire a pirate at a cost of any three resources.
- **Buy component**. At the Quantum Depot, discard the specified resources to purchase a quantum component. Players may purchase as many components as they are able in one action.
- **Jettison cargo**. Discard any amount of cargo of any type on the current planet.

> 🚀 Due to the effects of quantum teleportation, players do not need to worry which of their ships travels to the Quantum Depot. All cargo is instantly transferred to the ship docked at the Depot.

### Cleanup phase
After both players have concluded their action phase, prepare for the next round by performing the following actions:
1. Add one resource token to each discovered planet containing a resource, up to a maximum of three resources.
2. Discard all engine cards in engine control.
3. Retrieve any played PROBE cards.
4. Players may discard any number of engine tiles from their hand. Redraw engine tiles equal to the number of engine tiles discarded. Each player should have engine tiles equal to their hand size limit (default hand size is 3).

## Spaceship Encounters
Centarious and Superious are lawful, peaceful galaxies. Spaceships from opposing fleets may encounter each other in these galaxies with no effect.

Entanglion, on the other hand, is a lawless galaxy: a perfect home for the space pirates and their outposts. But beware, spaceships of the opposing fleet may also attack when you least expect it!

**When spaceships of opposing fleets encounter each other in Entanglion,** each player rolls the Entanglion (8-sided) die. The player with the higher number wins the attack. In case of a tie, the encounter results in a stalemate with no effect The winner of the encounter loots one resource of their choice from the loser.

> 📦 If the winner of an encounter is unable to store the resource looted from the other ship, it is jettisoned on the planet at which the encounter occurred.

> 🤷‍♂️ If the loser of the encounter doesn't have any resources, the winner does not receive any loot.

## Other Rules

### Quantum events
Quantum event cards may be played at any point in the game. Resolve the quantum event immediately when it is played. Players may hold a maximum of 3 quantum event cards in their hand.

> 🃏 Quantum event cards should be kept private from your opponent.

### Engine cards
There is a limit of 3 engine cards in your hand.

> At the beginning of the first round of the game, any player may discard and redraw all engine cards in their hand.

> 🃏 Engine cards should be kept private from your opponent.

### Cargo capacity & jettisoned cargo
Ships have finite cargo capacities. If your cargo holds are full, you cannot bring new cargo on board. You may jettison cargo at any time during your action phase. Jettisoned cargo orbits the planet at which it was jettisoned, enabling other players to travel there and pick it up. Cargo may be jettisoned on any planet in the quantum universe, not just in Entanglion. There is no limit to how much cargo can be placed on a single planet, although a planet containing three (or more) of the resource it produces will not be replenished.

### Pirate capacity
A maximum of four pirates may be recruited to your fleet.

> ☠️ While you may jettison cargo, pirates cannot be flushed out of airlocks.

### Detection Rate
The Detection Rate mechanic is not utilized in the Space Pirates expansion. Ships may freely enter and exit Entanglion without fear of Orbital defenses.

## Game End
There are 6 rounds in a standard game of Entanglion. Usually, the game ends at the end of the 6th round. When the round ends, a final quantum score consists of:

- The Quantum Point values of each quantum component a player owns
- Each pirate is worth 1 quantum point intrinsically

When the game ends, the player whose fleet has the higher quantum power is the winner. In case players' fleets have the same quantum power, the winner is the player with more resources.
